<h1>My Summer 2022-23 </h1>

<h2> At home and Adventuring </h2>

<p> My summer wasn't too bad in my opinion. Good weather for camping and 4wd.
    School holidays just go by too quick. New years was good until the day after :P 
    Got a little bit sunburnt in cromwell but it's all apart of the fun. </p>

<p> What I did:</p>
 <ul>
 <li> 4WD </li>
 <li> Camping </li>
 <li> Tanning with a side of sunburn </li>
 <li> Party Hardy on nys</li>
</ul>
